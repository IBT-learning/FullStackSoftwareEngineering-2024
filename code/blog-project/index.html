            <h3>Run with Friends</h3>
            <p class="content">
              Running solo can definitely have its moments of zen, but there’s
              nothing quite like having a buddy by your side when the going gets
              tough. Having that support system makes such a difference. When
              it’s just you, it’s easy to start making excuses and wanting to
              bail. But when you know someone’s counting on you to show up, it’s
              a whole other story. Plus, a little healthy competition never hurt
              anyone – having someone to push you to go that extra mile or pick
              up the pace can really work wonders.

            <h3>Training In the Heat Is Good For You</h3>
            <p class="content">
              As someone who’s been there, I can tell you that training in the
              heat isn’t just about being a glutton for punishment. Over time,
              it really helps your body adapt to those high temperatures. You
              start sweating more efficiently, your blood plasma volume
              increases, and you might even start to actually enjoy it – or at
              least, be able to tolerate it without feeling like you’re gonna
              pass out every time. It’s all about building up that heat
              tolerance. Your body gets smarter and better at handling the
              scorching weather. Sure, it’s not always fun in the moment, but
              trust me, it pays off in the long run. You’ll be able to push
              yourself harder, for longer, without feeling like you’re gonna
              melt.

            <h3>The Best All-Round Men’s and Women’s Trail Shoes</h3>
            <p class="content">
              The HOKA Speedgoat 5 is quite frankly, a masterpiece of trail
              running engineering when it comes to combining, comfort with
              performance and style. Named for Karl Meltzer aka “The Speedgoat”,
              who holds the record for the most 100-mile ultra trail race wins
              and epitomizes the “go everywhere, run everything” attitude, these
              trail running shoes are designed to attack all kinds of technical
              trails and are the best trail running shoes right now; they’re
              also one of HOKA’s top performing running shoes I’ve tested.

            <h3>Best Calorie Counting App</h3>
            <p class="content">
              #MyFitnessPal -This app has made it to the top of the list simply
              because it has a food database that includes 3,282,000 different
              food types. When you need to keep track of the calories you’re
              consuming, you’ll want a quick and easy food database that you can
              reference. You’ll be able to setup your own digital diary for
              counting calories without having to resort to self-reporting that
              never seems to work. This app is also extremely flexible. If
              you’re like me, you like to try different foods and eat out at
              different restaurants all the time. You’ll need this kind of app
              if you love food, love eating but don’t love the weight gain that
              comes with it!

            <h3>Shin Splints</h3>
            <p class="content">
              If your shins feel like they are on fire when you walk to the
              coffee pot, or run to the end of the driveway, there’s a chance
              you’ve got shin splints. When your muscles and tissues get
              overused, they become inflamed and irritated. This inflammation
              can come from an increase in volume, improper fitting or worn out
              shoes (lack of or too much support), and weak or imbalanced
              muscles. This is also common in track athletes due to the
              repetitive directional pull of the same muscles. Rest up. Gently
              massage your shins and apply ice for 10-15 minutes a few times per
              day to ease the inflammation. Stretch your ankles and shins by
              rotating your foot in circles while pressing your toes into the
              ground with your shoes on before and after activity.
