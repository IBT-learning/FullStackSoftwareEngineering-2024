    <h1>The Famous Oguta Lake</h1>
    <p class="text">Oguta Lake is a fresh water lake and the largest natural lake in south eastern part of Nigeria. The lake, encircled by green trees of the rain forest, is located in Oguta local government area of Imo State.</p>
    <h3>Why Oguta Lake is Special</h3>
    <p class="text">The special thing about Oguta Lake is that it is a lake of two rivers that never mix. One part, known as Ogbuide's side is clear, emerald green water. The other part, Urashi's side, has a distinct brown or reddish colour.</p>

    <h3>The Oguta Legend</h3>
    <p>A long time ago, Ogbuide and Urashi were a married couple, and flowed together.</p>
    <p>One day, they had a terrible argument (some say a quarrel, others a fight).
    In their rage, they separated and refused to flow together ever again.
    </p>

    <p>This is why till today, Oguta Lake is famous for having two distinct sections:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ogbuide's side: with its clear, emerald green water.</li>
      <li>Urashi's side: with a distinct brown or reddish colour.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="text">The legend says that the two rivers never reconciled, and that's why their waters never mix.</p>
    <p class="text">This story adds a layer of magic and wonder to the already stunning Oguta Lake, a place many tourists love to visit for its history and folklore.</p>
