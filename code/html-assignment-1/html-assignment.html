    <h1 class="sub-header">Welcome to Africa</h1>

    <p id="para" class="p"><i>Africa is well known for the diversity of its landscapes, 
        from the sun-scorched plains of the Serengeti to the white sand beaches of Zanzibar. 
        But it’s also got some pretty impressive mountains, 
        many over 4000 metres and relatively unexplored compared to those in the Alps and the Himalayas.

            <p id="para1" class="p">Mount Kilimanjaro is a dormant volcano in Tanzania. With three volcanic cones — Kibo, Mawenzi and Shira — it is the highest mountain in Africa and the highest single free-standing mountain above sea level in the world: 5,895 m (19,341 ft) above sea level and 4,900 m (16,100 ft) above its plateau base. It is also the highest volcano in the Eastern Hemisphere.

                Kilimanjaro is the fourth most topographically prominent peak on Earth. It is part of Kilimanjaro National Park and is a major hiking and climbing destination. Because of its shrinking glaciers and ice fields, which are projected to disappear between 2025 and 2035, it has been the subject of many scientific studies.

            <p id="para1" class="p">Mount Kenya is an extinct volcano in Kenya and the second-highest peak in Africa, after Kilimanjaro. The highest peaks of the mountain are Batian (5,199 metres (17,057 feet)), Nelion (5,188 m (17,021 ft)) and Point Lenana (4,985 m (16,355 ft)). Mount Kenya is located in the former Eastern and Central provinces of Kenya; its peak is now the intersection of Meru, Embu, Kirinyaga, Nyeri and Tharaka Nithi counties, about 16.5 kilometres (10.3 miles) south of the equator, around 150 km (90 mi) north-northeast of the capital Nairobi. Mount Kenya is the source of the name of the Republic of Kenya.</p>

            <h3 class="head3"><mark>Mount Stanley</mark></h3>
            <p id="para1" class="p">Mount Stanley or Mount Ngaliema is a mountain located in the Rwenzori range. With an elevation of 5,109 m (16,763 ft), it is the highest mountain of both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, and the third highest in Africa, after Kilimanjaro (5,895 m) and Mount Kenya (5,199 m). The peak and several other surrounding peaks are high enough to support glaciers. Mount Stanley is named for the journalist and explorer, Sir Henry Morton Stanley. It is part of the Rwenzori Mountains National Park, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
                <p>Mount Stanley consists of two twin summits and several lower peaks</p>

            <h3 class="head3"><mark>Mount Speke </mark></h3>
            <p id="para1" class="p">Mount Speke lies in the Ruwenzori Mountains National Park in Uganda and is the second highest mountain in this range. Together with Mount Stanley and Mount Baker, it forms a triangle enclosing the upper Bujuku Valley. The nearest peak is Mount Stanley, which is 3.55 km (2.21 mi) to the south-southwest. The mountains lie within an area called 'The Mountains of the Moon'.

                All mountains in this range consist of multiple jagged peaks. Mount Speke's summits are Vittorio Emanuele 4,890 m (16,040 ft); Ensonga 4,865 m (15,961 ft); Johnston 4,834 m (15,860 ft); and Trident 4,572 m (15,000 ft). The names were chosen in respect for the Italian royal family; however, the name choice had to be approved by the British Protectorate of Uganda who ruled the region at that time.</p>
