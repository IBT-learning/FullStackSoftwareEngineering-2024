    <h1>Ocean Waves</h1>
    <h2>The beauty of an ocean</h2>
   <p class="text">Ocean waves are disturbances in the surface of the ocean <a href="https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/OceanWaves#:~:text=Ocean%20Waves%20are%20disturbances%20in,in%20a%20given%20sample%20period.">Physical Oceanography(Podaac)</a>.
    They can be created by wind, gravity, or other displacements of water. 
    Satellites typically measure significant wave height, which is the avearge wave height of the highest third Waves in a given sample period.
    Also, the movement of energy through water molecules causing them to rise and fall. 
    Waves are often depicted to represent life, motion, and change.Water purity signifies the cleansing of the spirit. </p>

        <h3>Types of ocean waves</h3>
        <p class="text">The ocean waves, ever constant and ever changing, remind us of the beauty of nature
            forever etched into the fabric of the sea.</p>
       <p class="text">Transcending beyond imagination while representing a magical story of how these waves are brought to live.</p>
        <ol class="orange-text">

            <li class="orange.text">Surging Waves:They are produced when huge swells reach shorelines having a steep profile. 
                They travel at a high speed and don't usually break as the water below them is very Deep.
                They occur in areas where there is deep water very close to the shore.</li>



            <li class="orange.text">Storm Surge:A storm surge, storm flood, tidal surge, or storm tide is a coastal flood or tsunami-like
                phenomenon of rising water commonly associated with low pressure weather systems, such as cyclone.  
                It is measured as the rise in water level above the normal tideal level.
                When the moon, rather than the wind, tugs on the ocean's surface, tidal waves form.</li>



            <li class="orange.text">Seiche waves: Also knwon as standing waves that occur in a limited or partly confined body of water.
                It can form in any enclosed or semi-enclosed body.</li>



            <li class="orange.text">Swells:They are long-period waves that have travelled out of their area of origin.
                They are usually more regular and evenly spaced out than wind waves.
                Away from the generation wind system, we can recognize long crested and regular waves known as swells.</li>
        </ol>

     <P class="text" id="Block-wrapper">
       Sometimes, you just have to go with the waves. Feelings are much like waves: we can't stop them from coming, but we can choose which one to surf.
       Let the waves hit your feet and the sand be your seat.
       The waves of the sea help me get back to me. Waves are the voices of tides. Tides are life.
       Life's a wave; catch it.
