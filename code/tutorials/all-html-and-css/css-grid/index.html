    <p>Whilst the Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box)-one of the CSS layout model aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out. align and distribute space among items in a containeer, even thier size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex"). The main idea behind flex layout is to give the containner the ability to alter its items width/height (and other) to best fill the available space (mostly to accomodate to all kinds of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available space or shrinks them to prevent overflow. Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction agnostic (meaning that you can control the alignment, distribution and order of items along both the main axis (either hrozontal or vertical, depending on the flex-direction property) and the cross axis. Note: Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while Grid layout is intended for larger scale layout.</p>
    <p>The CSS Grid is a two-dimensional grid-based  layout system that, compared to any web layout system of thepast completely changes the way we design user interfaces. CSS has alwas been used to layout our web pages, but it's never done a very good job of it. First we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering for instance). <b><u>Flexbox</u></b> is also a very great layout tool, but it's one-directional flow has different use cases-and they actually work together quite well (flexbox and grid). Grid is the very first CSS module created specifically to solve the layout problems we've been hacking our way around for as long as we've been making websites. </p>
    <h3>CSS GRID BASICS</h3>
    <p>To get started we have to define a container element as a grid with <u>display: grid</u>, set the column and row sizes with <u>grid-template-columns</u> and <u>grid-template-rows</u>, and then place its child elements into the grid with <u>grid-column</u> and <u>grid-row.</u> Similar to flexbox, the source order of the grid items doesn't matter.</p>
    <p>A parent cannot be both a grid and flexbox at the same time however any item could be a grid parent and a flex child or a grid child and a flex parent at the same time</p>
    <p>Also remember that grid column/row lines numbering is different from grid column/row numbering where the later is the actual column or row</p>
