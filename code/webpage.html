      Dome Pools is a wilderness hiking venue, involving an easy walk over a
      hill and along a stream to some of the biggest and deepest rock pools in
      the Magaliesberg, making it a fantastic venue for swimming in the summer
      months.

        The first time i did this hike was on a high school camping trip. It was
        long and a moderate toughness hike with a lot of rocks to tackle. The
        pain of the hike was worth it when we reached the pools and got to jump
        into the waterfall. It was an experience of a lifetime and I cannot wait
        to go back
