    <div class="about">
        <p>
            In a world of crayons and toys, lives a heart as pure as gold and a mind as creative as a rainbow. <span><strong>Pablo Picasso</strong></span> once said, "Every child is an artist. The problem is how to remain an artist once we grow up." This is the essence of <span><strong>Creatively Childish</strong></span>. We are here to nurture the artist in you, unleash the creator in her and embrace the child in all of us. We are here to celebrate the creativity, the innocence and the wonder that is childhood. We are here to celebrate you.
            </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Childhood is a time of <span><strong>innocence.</strong></span></li>
            <li>Childhood is a time of <span><strong>creativity.</strong></span></li>
            <li>Childhood is a time of <span><strong>wonder.</strong></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I pray to never loose you in the world of grown-ups. I pray to never loose you in the world of deadlines and bills. I pray to never loose you in the world of "maturity".
