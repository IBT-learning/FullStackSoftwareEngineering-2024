<h1>EKO ATLANTIC CITY DEVELOPMENT</h1>
<h2>Victoria Island,Lagos State,Nigeria</h2>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>The Project is an extension of Victoria Island, Lagos State, Nigeria.</p>
<p>There is a projected rise in sea levels due to climate change. Lagos, Nigeria, is one of such cities already experiencing the impacts of coastal erosion. With a current population of 22 million inhabitants, it is the most populous city on the continent and one of the fastest growing cities in the world. Victoria Island is its main business and financial centre. The Lagos Central Business District (CBD) can be regarded as the original financial hub of the state as the Nigerian Stock Exchange, Central Bank as well as the head offices of the biggest commercial banks. The CBD of Lagos is at risk of being eroded, inundated and decimated by coastal erosion. This level of coastal erosion has devastating effects and induces the loss of infrastructure such as buildings rail, bridges, roads etc. It also threatens populations, who can no longer live close to the coastline.</p>
<p>Over the past 100 years, the shoreline of Victoria Island retreated significantly (locally even 2 kilometers) with disastrous consequences (including loss of land, houses, livelihood sources, amenity uses, etc.) on the communities adjacent to the sea and around Victoria Island. These events and the damaging consequences to Lagos has called for immediate intervention. Without any action, highly valued areas of residential and commercial properties will continue to be threatened by the intrusion of sea water with resultant destruction of properties, loss of income, lives and livelihood.</p>
<p>There was an incident in 2005 where the entire Bar Beach was lost to erosion leaving Victoria Island directly exposed to heavy ocean surges with no protection from the Atlantic Ocean. The solution proffered was then was sea revetment consisting of concrete Xbloc armour units which protected the coastline. However, a permanent and more extensive solution was considered necessary to address the persistent erosion problem. This necessitated the creation of the Eko Atlantic project, which consisted of the construction of the “Great Wall of Lagos” and the Eko Atlantic City which was constructed on reclaimed land.</p>

    <h3>SHORELINE PROTECTION:GREAT WALL OF LAGOS</h3>
    <p>The Great Wall of Lagos was built to ensure that everyone living and working in the ten square kilometres of reclaimed land for Eko Atlantic and the population of Victoria Island are protected from the sea. The design splits into 12 different layers of rock and concrete which form this massive structure.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Filter layer</li>
        <li>Under-layer</li>

    <h3>LAND RECLAMATION</h3>
    <p>The main reclaimed area is approximately 8 km long, with a width of 1.5 km on the western end, tapering to 0.5 km on the eastern end. The outer edge of the reclaimed area is protected from the sea by an approximately 8 km long rock revetment to provide shoreline protection to the new land and to Victoria Island.</p>
    <p>The reclamation activities and associated works include the following tasks, which are further
        described below:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dredging of sand for reclamation from offshore borrow areas.</li>
            <li>Pre-construction: Strengthening of the East Mole by quarry materials to enable use of the
                mole as an access road.
                </li>
            <li>Construction: Construction of the sea defence, using several grades of quarry materials,geotextile fabrics and pre-cast concrete armour units.</li>
            <li>Construction: Dredging of sand and sand placement for reclamation.</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>CITY MASTERPLANNING</h3>
    <p>Eko Atlantic is a large-scale city development. The Eko philosophy implies that the development will be self-sufficient and sustainable with its surrounding environment. Self-sufficiency includes amongst others power generation, water supply, waste water treatment and appropriate solid waste management. Sustainability refers to sound demographic distribution and pleasant living conditions with an attempt to limit emissions to its surrounding environment.</p>
    <p>Eko Atlantic city will include residential, commercial, financial and tourist developments. The distribution of land use type shows that the urban development is predominantly residential (63%) followed by offices (18%). The commercial and retail developments comprise 9% of the total area, while 6% and 4% for recreational and leisure facilities and services respectively.</p>
    <p>
        Eko Atlantic city is divided into the following 10 districts and 1 service area which include;
        <ol>
            <li>Business District</li>
            <li>Harbour Lights</li>
            <li>Ocean Front</li>
            <li>Marina District</li>
            <li>Downtown</li>
            <li>Eko Island</li>
            <li>Avenues</li>
            <li>Four Bridges</li>
            <li>Eko Drive</li>
            <li>East Side Marina District</li>
            <li>The far-east the Utility plot for utilities and services</li>
        </ol>
