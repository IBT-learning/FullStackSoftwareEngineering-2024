    <h1>Lewa Wildlife Conservancy</h1>
    <div>
        <h2>Overview and Brief History</h2>
        <p>Lewa conservancy also known as Lewa Downs is approximately 259.5 kilometres from Nairobi, located in Meru County, south of Isiolo town.
        The conservancy was founded by the Craig family and Anna Merz. The Craig family used the land as a cattle ranch for 50 years when they 
        arrived in 1920s. Their ranch was different as they valued the local wildlife and they shared it with wild animals even 
        allowing tourists to visit. </p>

        <p> During the 1980s period Anna Merz and Craig decided to build  a house to protect the Rhinos which were critically threatened by poaching. 
        They started with just 5,000 acres of land in which they fenced with electric fence and their effort was such a great success that 
        they had to relocate many of the Rhinos in Northern Kenya to protect them.</p>

        <p>Their conservation efforts were so successful that tourist across the world started visiting. These made the Craig family to devote 
        the entire 40,000 acre ranch to create the Lewa conservancy. The ranch is fenced, with just a few gaps which 
        to enable the movements of animals in and out of the conservancy into other wildlife protected areas around the conservancy.</p>
