        near a group of rocky outcrops in a wooded savanna; 77 kilometres north of Lagos by railway,

        <p> Climb the legendary Olumo Rock famed as the founding site of Abeokuta. A massive outcrop of granite rock that towers 
            above the city, the rock served as a natural fortress for the Egba people during the 19th century. 
            It offered a great vantage point during the tribal wars and helped the locals win the wars.</p>
